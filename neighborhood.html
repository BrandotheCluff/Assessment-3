<p>
    In the land of Gilbert you will find many delcious restaurants. 
    Some of which are local and were born in the area, others are imported from others
    states! Since Gilbert is such a melting pot, there is often a diverse selection. 
    It is actually home to one of my all-time favorite restaurants, ATL Wings. 
    Take the most delcious wings you've ever had and then imagine them better, they are so crispy
    and flavorful with the best sauce selection of any wing place I've ever been to.
    That is about all I ahve to say that is good about Gilbert other than my family that lives there.
    Restaurants and family are what make Gilbert a decent place for me.
